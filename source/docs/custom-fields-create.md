### Edit Custom Field

While editing,  **Name**  and  **Type**  **fields**  will become disabled. In case you want to change them, you will have to delete this custom field and start over. This is to prevent messing up with the DataBase.

Just for your information, the rest of the options are still open for editing and adding.
